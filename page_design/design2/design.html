				<p>“More smiling, less worrying. More compassion, less judgment. More blessed, less stressed. More love, less hate.”<br>“Accept yourself, love yourself, and keep moving forward. If you want to fly, you have to give up what weighs you down.” <br>“Live the Life of Your Dreams: Be brave enough to live the life of your dreams according to your vision and purpose instead of the expectations and opinions of others.” <br>“Be grateful for what you already have while you pursue your goals. If you aren’t grateful for what you already have, what makes you think you would be happy with more.”  </p>
